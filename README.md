# Notes-Web-App
I made a notes web app, used some npm packages on it, integrated it with Google Firestore. Another version of it uses localStorage.

This app uses the **LocalStorage** on your local machine browser to store your notes!

This is a pretty useful feature to store miniscule amounts of data without the need of a backend.
